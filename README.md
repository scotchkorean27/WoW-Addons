# WoW-Addons
A coupple of Lua based projects I thought would be fun.  If you have any interesting ideas, I'd love to hear them.
For the time being, most of the stuff here will be addons for World of Warcraft.
Frankly, I don't care you want to use this code or do whatever, as long as the honorable mentions (if applicable) are still in the toc file.
